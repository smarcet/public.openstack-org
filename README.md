## Overview

The OpenStack Foundation Website

WHAT IS IT?

This project includes the code that powers the openstack.org website, which is itself powered by a PHP web application called Silverstripe, and we've made several customizations to meet the specific needs of OpenStack. More about the Silverstripe CMS is available here: http://silverstripe.org/

This repository is designed to help other project members develop, test, and contribute to the openstack.org website project, or to build other websites. Note that this project is based on ther code that powers the public openstack.org _website_ , not the openstack cloud software itself. To participate in building the actual OpenStack cloud platform software, go to:

WHY RELEASE THE SOURCE?

The OpenStack.org website helps promote OpenStack, the open source cloud computing platform.  We felt it only make sense to share the code that powers our website so that other open source projects might benefit, and so that developers in our community might help us improve the code that powers the website dedicated to promoting their favorite open source project.  

A REMINDER ON TRADEMARKS:

In light of the trademarks held by the OpenStack Foundation, it is important that you not use the code to build a website or webpage that could be confused with the openstack.org website, including by building a site or page with the same look and feel of the openstack.org site or by using trademarks that are the same as or similar to marks found on the openstack.org site. For the rules regarding other uses of OpenStack trademarks, see the OpenStack Trademark Policy http://www.openstack.org/brand/openstack-trademark-policy/ and the OpenStack Brand Guide http://www.openstack.org/brand/.

WHAT'S INCLUDED
Included in this repository are:

Third Party:
- The Silverstripe CMS v 3.1.x (via Composer, for easy of deployment)

WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED

REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPLOYING

To run, the server environment needs:
- Apache 1.3 or greater
- PHP 5.2.0 or greater
- MySQL 5.0 or greater

INSTALLATION

The project uses composer (https://getcomposer.org/) to manage all dependencies

to install run following commands

* curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
* php composer.phar install
* php composer.phar dump-autoload --optimize
* chmod 777 -R  vendor/ezyang/htmlpurifier/library/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache/Serializer

DATABASE
OpenStack will provide a db dump on a weekly basis, purged of protected data. The dump can be found https://mycloud.rackspace.com/cloud/920805/files#object-store%2CcloudFiles%2CDFW/www.openstack.org-cron-db-backups-purged/. The database will create one default admin user. All other data will need to be populated by the user.

TODO:
We need detailed installation instructions to run the site locally on LAMP or MAMP.

SUBMITTING PATCHES:

We ask that all contributors sign the OpenStack CLA, consistent with how we manage other OpenStack projects: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute#Contributor_License_Agreement .  Please note that this process is based on the Apache Software Foundation model, and the CLA does NOT require copyright assignment.

In the future we will integrate with the OpenStack gerrit system for managing reviwes. Once that is rolled out, the CLA signature check will be automated to prevent unauthorized pull requests. In the interim, we will verify contributors manually based on the email address associated with their Gerrit account. If your email address in gerrit is different than the one you use for github, please note that in the pull request.
